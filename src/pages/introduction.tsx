      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        I am a student who is passionate about English. I love to program something. In this portfolio, I will
        showcase my writing skills and my ability to analyze and interpret
        texts.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have included a variety of pieces of writing in my portfolio,
        including essays, poems, and short stories. I have also included some of
        my research papers and creative projects. I hope that these pieces of
        writing will give you a better understanding of my skills and my
        interests.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am always looking for ways to improve my writing, and I am excited to
        share my work with you. I hope that you enjoy reading my portfolio and
        that you find it to be informative and engaging.
