        In conclusion, this portfolio has showcased my skills in English
        writing, research, and analysis. I have learned to write effectively in
        a variety of genres, including essays, research papers, and creative
        writing. I have also learned to conduct research and use evidence to
        support my claims. In addition, I have learned to analyze literature and
        identify its themes, symbols, and motifs.
